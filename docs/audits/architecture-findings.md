## Needs Manual Verification

| ID | Item | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| MV-01 | DashboardPage `getSalesByItemGroup()` call | Code exists but may be conditional — verify at runtime |
| MV-02 | Frappe DocType permissions | Role-based access via Frappe resource API depends on server-side config — cannot verify from code scan alone |
| MV-03 | CSRF token handling | Cookie parsing implementation — verify in deployed environment |

## Release Blockers

Based on the audit policy, the following are release-blocking:

| Finding | Reason | Waivable? |
|---|---|---|
| FIND-01 (Settings no backend) | User-visible broken functionality | Yes, if Settings marked as "Coming Soon" |
| FIND-06 (No role-based visibility) | Permission mismatch between visible UI and backend guards | Yes, if all users are admins in current deployment |
